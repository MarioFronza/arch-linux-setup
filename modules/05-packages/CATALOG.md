# Package catalog

Reference only — nothing reads this file. Regenerate it after editing any
package list: descriptions come from `pacman -Si` for repo packages, the AUR
RPC `info` endpoint for AUR ones.

Every package in `pacman.txt`, `gpu-*.txt`, and `aur.txt`, with the
description straight from pacman/AUR — generated from the current
package lists, not hand-maintained. See [`README.md`](README.md) for
how to install them.
