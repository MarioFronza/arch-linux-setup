==> arch-linux-setup install done. What is left is interactive, or takes the network
    down, so none of it runs here:

  1. Fill in ~/.config/git/identity (name, email, signing key path).

  2. Generate an SSH key if you have none, add the public key to GitHub
     under both Authentication and Signing, then map it for local
     verification:

       ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       printf '%s namespaces="git" %s\n' \
         "$(git config user.email)" "$(cut -d' ' -f1,2 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" \
         > ~/.config/git/allowed_signers

  3. gh auth login, picking SSH as the protocol, then switch the dotfiles
     clone to SSH so you can push from it:

       git -C ~/dotfiles remote set-url origin git@github.com:MarioFronza/dotfiles.git

  4. modules/05-packages/enable-services.sh, from the machine's own
     console — it takes the network with it.

  5. /theme inside Claude Code, to pick tokyo_night.
